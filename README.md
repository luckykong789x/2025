# Simple Mario-Style Game

This is a minimal web-based platformer built with HTML5 canvas and vanilla JavaScript.

## Playing the Game

Open `index.html` directly in a modern browser. If local file access is restricted, run the following command from this directory and open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

You should then see the game and can use the arrow keys to move and jump.
