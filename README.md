This repository contains a small browser platformer built with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript.

## Running Locally

Some browsers block scripts from running when opened directly from the filesystem. To play the game, start a local HTTP server from this directory and open `index.html` through that server.

If you have Python installed you can run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8000/index.html](http://localhost:8000/index.html) in your browser.

Use the arrow keys to move left and right, and press Up or Space to jump.
